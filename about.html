            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                I have always had a curious enthusiasm towards computers and technology. 
                One of my early childhood memories is dressing up as the Y2K bug for Halloween. 
                I remember the excitement of getting our first household computer, the original Xbox, MySpace, and the GameCube, as well as the challenge of trying to build my first computer or build my first website. 
                Now, as a recent graduate, I look back on my first computer science classes and my childhood, and see how far I have come.
                I am now looking for a perfect place to start my career and further my professional growth. 
                Using knowledge from my degree, past life experience, and previous on-the-job experience, I am eager to contribute to my next team.

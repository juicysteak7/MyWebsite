            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                I have always had a curious enthusiasm towards computers and technology. 
                One of my early childhood memories is dressing up as the Y2K bug for Halloween. 
                I remember the excitement of getting our first household computer, the original Xbox, MySpace, and the GameCube, as well as the challenge of trying to build my first computer or build my first website. 
                Now, as a recent graduate, I look back on my first computer science classes and my childhood, and see how far I have come.
                I am now looking for a perfect place to start my career and further my professional growth. 
                Using knowledge from my degree, past life experience, and previous on-the-job experience, I am eager to contribute to my next team.

            <p> What originally was a 6 month internship got extended another 6 months due to outstanding work and team necessity. 
                My team and I built and maintained numours integrations between Salesforce and other systems.
                Most of the integrations leveraged AWS to ensure we had reliable data transformations and transfers.
                Many of the integrations were also using SQL procedures and SQL databases.

            </p>
            <p> During my 6 months internship at Daimler Truck North America I was focused on converting aging inventory management applications.
                These web applications ran on old .NET frameworks. 
                I upgraded the code and enhanced it using a modern .NET stack.
                The main goal was to increase preformance, readability, and reliability, and reduce future maintainence.

        <h2>Bookie</h2>
        <p>This chatbot was built for my Voice Application class. 
            Bookie is designed to streamline the student textbook purchasing process. 
            By potentially integrating with the school’s class requirements, and the school library, as well as online options, students can request a list of all the textbooks they need for a term and purchase them seamlessly. 
            Bookie enables students to check stock availability in real-time, ensuring they know what is in stock or out of stock, making the textbook acquisition process efficient and hassle-free.</p>

        <h2>Lang2Views - Senior Capstone</h2>
        <p>
            This web application was designed to speed up the workflow of Lang2Views employees.
            Lang2Views works with many content creators to localize thier content so they can reach broader audiences.

            <br><br>Technologies Breakdown
            <br>Backend
            <br>Our team implemented the backend in TypeScript, using the Node.js runtime environment and Express for routing. In addition to creating our own API, the backend also makes use of OpenAI’s Whisper for automation of speech transcription; Dropbox’s API for automation of folder creation and file uploads; Trello’s API for automation of Trello ticket creation; YouTube’s API for automation of video downloading and uploading; and Google’s API for automation of document script creating.
            
            <br><br>Database
            <br>Our team used a database of .JSON files with classes to manage CRUD operations.
            
            <br><br>Frontend
            <br>Our team implemented the frontend of the product using JavaScript and React with CSS/Bootstrap for styling. 
            
            <br><br>DevOps
            <br>DevOps will containerize the application with Docker and use AWS EC2 to run the container.

            <br><br>If you are iterested in more specifics of the application or the project you can look at the project documentation and code below.

        <h2>Bookie</h2>
        <p>This chatbot was built for my Voice Application class. 
            Text interpretation is a crucial step in understanding requests in a voice application. 
            Bookie is designed to streamline the student textbook purchasing process. 
            By potentially integrating with the schoolâ€™s class requirements, students can request a list of all the textbooks they need for a term and purchase them seamlessly. 
            Bookie enables students to check stock availability in real-time, ensuring they know what is in stock or out of stock, making the textbook acquisition process efficient and hassle-free.</p>
